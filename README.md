# Bellabeat_case_study
This was my first project done as part of Google data analytics certificate course.
This project deals with use of fitbit fitness tracker data that will help Bellabeat company (a hightech manufacturer of women health focused products) to understand how the users uses their smart devices.
As well as coming up with new marketing strategies.
